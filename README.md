Tic-Tac-Toe Project

Overview:
This project is an implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O') in an attempt to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.

Features:

Two-Player Game: The game supports two players, allowing them to take turns playing against each other.
Responsive Design: The interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal gameplay experience across different devices and screen sizes.
Winning Detection: The game detects and announces the winner when a player successfully forms a line of three consecutive symbols.
Draw Detection: If all spaces on the board are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game declares a draw.
Reset Option: Players can reset the game at any point to start a new round.
File Structure:

index.html: Contains the structure and layout of the game board and interface.
style.css: Defines the styles for the game's appearance and layout.
script.js: Implements the game logic and functionality using JavaScript.
README.md: This file, providing information about the project.
How to Run:
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser that supports JavaScript.

Gameplay:

Players take turns clicking on an empty space on the grid to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
The game continues until one player forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three consecutive symbols, or until the grid is completely filled without a winner.
To start a new game, click the reset button to clear the board and begin a new round.
